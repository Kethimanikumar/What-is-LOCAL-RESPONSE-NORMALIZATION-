Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been doing wonders in the field of image recognition in recent times. CNN is a type of deep neural network in which the layers are connected using spatially organized patterns. This is in line with how the human visual cortex processes image data. Researchers have been working on coming up with better architectures over the last few years. In this blog post, we will discuss a particular type of layer that has been used consistently across many famous architectures. This layer is called Local Response Normalization layer and it plays an important role. What does it do? Whatâ€™s the advantage of having this in our network?
